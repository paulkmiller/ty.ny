== Ty.Ny Url Shortener

### GA WDI DC August 2014, Project 1

### Overview

**Ty.Ny** is a URL shortener with basic user functions. The overall goal was to create a functional shortener that would route back to the original link using Bitly's API. Having pivoted between three different project ideas, I settled on this with roughly two days worth of time from conception to this working model.

*Future Plans* include adding User functionality beyond signing in and signing out-- e.g. user's will be able to reference their previous links on their user profiles and track how many times each link was clicked.
